    <h1>About salty.wav:</h1>
    <p>Yiannis Veronis (salty.wav), was born in Athens in May 2007. From an early age he began to have a special relationship with music. At the age of five, he came into contact with the piano and classical music. Later, he began to experiment with other instruments, such as the classical guitar, flute and drums. His musical listening is varied, but his greatest love is house and more specifically bass house, with which he also deals as a composer.</p>
